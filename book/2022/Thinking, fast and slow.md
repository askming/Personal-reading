## How judgements happen

- System 1 can't deal with sum-like variables effectively; it works well with averages

## Answering an easier question

- P97, bottom, the concept of substitution
- P98, top, the definition of heuristic

### characteristics of system 1

- generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by System 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions
- operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort, and no sense of voluntary control
- can be programmed by System 2 to mobilize attention when a particular pattern is detected (search)
- executes skilled responses and generates skilled intuitions, after adequate training
- creates a coherent pattern of activated ideas in associative memory
- links a sense of cognitive ease to illusions of truth, pleasant feelings, and reduced vigilance
- distinguishes the surprising from the normal
- infers and invents causes and intentions
- neglects ambiguity and suppresses doubt
- is biased to believe and confirm
- exaggerates emotional consistency (halo effect)
- focuses on existing evidence and ignores absent evidence (WYSIATI)
- generates a limited set of basic assessments
- represents sets by norms and prototypes, does not integrate
- matches intensities across scales (e.g., size to loudness) computes more than intended (mental shotgun)
- sometimes substitutes an easier question for a difficult one (heuristics)
- is more sensitive to changes than to states (prospect theory)
- overweights low probabilities
- shows diminishing sensitivity to quantity (psychophysics)
- responds more strongly to losses than to gains (loss aversion)
- frames decision problems narrowly, in isolation from one another

## The law of small numbers

- P112, middle, for a research psychologist, sampling variation is not a curiosity; it is a nuisance and a costly obstacle, which turns the undertaking of every research project into a gamble.

- P115, top, Instead of focusing on how the event at hand came to be, the statistical view relates it to what could have happened instead. Nothing in particular caused it to be what it is - chance selected it from among its alternatives.

- P116, bottom, there is no such a thing as hot hand in professional basketball - research showed. It's related with the tendency to see patterns in randomness.

*2021-10-09*

## Availability, emotion, and risk

- P139, top, people form opinions and make choices that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or avoid, often without knowing that they are doing so. 
- The emotional tail wags the rational dog. Jonathan Haidt
- P142, top, the availability cascade

## Tom W's specialty

- Base rate vs detailed description
- impact of Representativeness in decision making
- P154, bottom, the essential keys to disciplined Bayesian reasoning can be simply summarized:
  - Anchor your judgement of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate
  - Question the diagnosticity of your evidence

## Linda: less is more

- P158, bottom, conjunction fallacy: people commit when they judge a conjunction of two events to be more probable than one of the events in a direct comparison

## Causes trump statistics

- P174, top, subject's unwillingness to deduce particular to general was matched only by willingness to infer the general from the particular. 
- P174, bottom, surprising individual cases have a powerful impact and are more effective tool for teaching psychology because the incongruity must be resolved and embedded in causal story.

## Regression to the mean

- P177, top, 
  > success = talent + luck
  > great success = a little more talent + a lot of luck
- P181, bottom, regression and correlation are not two concepts; whenever the correlation between two scores is imperfect, there will be regression to the mean

## Taming intuitive predictions

- P192, top, intuitive predictions tend to be overconfident and overly extreme. 
- Extreme predictions and willingness to predict rare events from rare evidence are both manifestations of System 1.

## The illusion of understanding

- P199, top, narrative fallacy
- P202, middle, once you adopt a new view of the world (out of any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed. 
- P203, bottom, outcome bias

## The illusion of validity

-  P211, bottom, the illusion of validity
- P212, middle, Subjective confidence in a juagment is not a reasoned evaluation of the probability that this judgment is correct. Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and cognitive ease of processing it. It is wise to take admissions of uncertainty seriously, but declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true.
- _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_ by Burton Malkiel
- P218, 2nd paragraph, march of history
- P220, top, hedgehog vs fox analogy

## Intuitions Vs formulas

- Paul Meehl, _clinical vs statistical prediction:a theoretical analysis and a review of the evidence_
- P225, top, inconsistency in personal evaluation is typical, which may be the main reason that leads to bad performance in human prediction
- P225, middle, inconsistency is destructive of any predictive ability

## Expert intuition: when to trust it?
- Malcolm Gladwell: _Blink_
- P236, bottom, recognition-primed decision 
- P237, top, Herbert Simon's definition of intuition: the situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition. 
- P240, top, confidence that people have in their intuition is not a reliable guide to their validity
- P240, 2nd paragraph, two basic conditions for acquiring a skill:
  - an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable
  - an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice
- P241, middle, intuition can't be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment. 
- P241, bottom, whether professionals have a chance to develop intuitive expertise depends essentially on the quality and speed of feedback,as well as on sufficient opportunity to practice.

## The outside view
- P249, 2nd paragraph, people who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the  class to which the case belongs.
- P250, top, _planning fallacy_, plans and forecasts that
  - are unrealistically close to best-case scenarios
  - could be improved by consulting the statistics of similar cases
- P251, bottom, _reference class forecasting_ (the treatment for the planning fallacy)
- P251, bottom, practices to overcome best-rate neglect:
  - Identify an appropriate reference class (kitchen renovations, large railway projects, etc.)
  - Obtain the statistics of the reference class (in terms of cost per mile of railway, or of the percentage by which expenditures exceeded budget), Use the statistics to generate a baseline prediction.
  - Use specific information about the case to adjust the baseline prediction, if there are particular reasons to expect the optimistic bias to be more or less pronounced in this project than in others of the same type.

## The engine of capitalism
- P259, bottom, cognitive biases play an important role, notably the System 1 feature WYSIATI.
  - We focus on our goal, anchor on our plan, and neglect relevant base rates, exposing ourselves to the planning fallacy
  - We focus on what we want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others
  - Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the. causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We are therefore prone to an _illusion of control_.
  - We focus on what we know and neglect what we don't know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs.
- P262, bottom, "one-arm economist" who will take a clear stand and won't keep saying "On the other hand..." in his/her reasoning
- P264, bottom, Gary Klein's proposal of _premortem_. When the organization has almost come to an important decision but has not formally committed itself, Klein proposes gathering for a brief session a group of individuals who are knowledgeable about the decision. The premise of the session is a short speech: "_Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster._"

## Bernoulli's errors
- P270, middle, _expected utility theory_, which was the foundation of the _rational-agent model_ (to this day the most important theory in the social sciences.)
- P272, top, _prospect theory_; developed as a modified expected utility theory just enough to explain authors' collection of observation.
- P273, bottom, 
  - Bernoulli invented psychophysics to explain the aversion to risk: people's choices are based not on dollar values but on the psychological values of outcomes, their _utilities_.
  - The psychological value of a gamble is therefore not the weighted average of its possible dollar outcomes; it is the average of the utilities of these outcomes, each weighted by its probability
 - P277, top, theory-induced blindness: once you have accepted a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws (refers to Bernoulli's error)

## Prospect theory
-  P281, bottom, Bernoulli's model is too simple and lacks a moving part. The missing variable is the _reference point_, the earlier state relative to which gains and losses are evaluated.
- P282, top, operating characteristics of System 1
  - Evaluation is the relative to a neutral reference point, which is sometimes referred to as an "adaptation level".
  - A principle of diminishing sensitivity applies to both sensory dimensions and the evaluation of changes of wealth.
  - The third principle is loss aversion. When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains.
- P284, top, the "loss aversion ration"
- P287, bottom, prospect theory cannot deal with disappointment. 
- P287, bottom, prospect theory and utility theory also fail to allow for regret.

## The endowment effect

- P289, Fig. 11, indifference curves
- P292, top, two aspects of choice that the standard model of indifference curves does not predict.
  - First, tastes are not fixed; they vary with the reference point
  - Second, the disadvantages of a change loom larger than its advantages, inducing a bias that favors the status quo.

## Bad events
- P301, middle, the brains of humans and other animals contain a mechanism that is designed to give priority to bad news. By shaving a few hundredths of a second from the time needed to detect a predator, this circuit improves the animal's odds of living long enough to reproduce.

## The fourfold pattern

- P311, bottom, _possibility effect_ and _certainty effect_
- P312, 3rd paragraph, The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle.
- P312, bottom, Allais's paradox
- P317, top, fourfold pattern of preference (figure 13)

## Rare events 

- P324, top, Although overestimation and overweighting are distinct phenomena, the same psychological mechanisms are involved in both: focused attention, confirmation bias, and cognitive ease
- P325, top, The probability of a rare event is most likely to be overestimated when the alternative is not fully specified.
- P328, top, a rich and vivid representation of the outcome, whether or not it is emotional, reduces the role of probability in the evaluation of an uncertain prospect.
- P329, top, _denominator neglect_. people pay little attention to the denominator (total) but just to the changes in numerator (absolute number of chances)

## Risk policies

- P336, top, there are two ways of constructing decisions i and ii:
  - narrow framing: a sequence of two simple decisions, considered separately
  - broad framing: a single comprehensive decision, with four options

- P339, middle, In the narrow-framing condition, they were told to "make each decision as if it were the only one" and to accept their emotions. The instructions for broad framing of a decision included the phrases "imagine yourself as a trader", "you do this all the time", and "treat it as one of many monetary decision, which will sum together to produce a 'portfolio'".
- P339, bottom, broad framing blunted the emotional reaction to looses and increased the willingness to take risks.
- P339, bottom, The combination of loss aversion and narrow framing is a costly curse. Individual investors can avoid that curse, achieving the emotional benefits of broad framing while also saving time and agony, by reducing the frequency with which they check how well their investments are doing.
- P340, bottom, The outside view and the risk policy are remedies against two distinct biases that affect many decisions: the exaggerated optimism of the planning fallacy and the exaggerated caution induced by loss aversion.

## Keeping score

- P344, 4th paragraph, the _disposition effect_ is an instance of narrow framing
- P345, top, The decision to invest additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available, is known as the _sunk-cost fallacy_.
- P348, top, people expect to have stronger emotional reactions (including regret) to an outcome that is produced by action than to the same outcome when it is produced by inaction.
- P351, bottom, The dilemma between intensely loss-averse moral attitudes, and efficient risk management does not have a simple and compelling solution
- P352, bottom, Daniel Gilbert and his colleagues provocatively claim that people generally anticipate more regret than they will actually experience, because they underestimate the efficacy of the psychological defenses they will deploy-- with they label the "psychological immune system". Their recommendation is that you should not put too much weight on regret; even if you have some, it will hurt less than you now think.

## Reversals

- P360, top, _evaluability hypothesis_: the number of entries is given no weight in single evaluation, because the numbers are not "evaluable" on their own.

## Frames and reality

- P366, The framing study yielded three main findings:
  - A region that is commonly associated with emotional arousal (the amygdala) was most likely to be active when subjects' choices conformed to the frame.
  - A brain region known to be associates with conflict and self-control (the anterior cingulate) was more active when subjects did not do what comes naturally - when they chose the sure thing in spite of its being labeled LOSE. Resisting the inclination of System 1 apparently involves conflict.
  - The most "rational" subjects - those who were the least susceptible to framing effects - showed enhanced activity in a frontal area of the brain that is implicated in combining emotion and reasoning to guide decisions.

- P367, bottom, Unless there is an obvious reason to do otherwise, most of us passively accept decision problems as they are framed and therefore rarely have an opportunity to discover the extent to which our preferences are frame-bound rather than reality-bound.
- P368, bottom, Decision makers tend to prefer the sure thing over the gamble (they are risk averse) when the outcomes are good. They tend to reject the sure thing and accept the gamble (they are risk seeking) when both outcomes are negative.
- P373, middle, example that illustrates how the default option as opt-out vs opt-in affects the rate of willing to donate organ in culturally similar countries

## Two selves

- P377, _experienced utility_ vs _decision utility_
- P381, top, two selves, experiencing self and remembering self
- P384, 2nd to the last paragraph, peak-end rule, duration neglect

## Life as a story

- _NA_

## Experienced well-beings

- P395, middle, The feeling associated with different activities suggest that another way to improve experience is to switch time from passive leisure, such as TV watching, to more active forms of leisure, including socializing and exercise.
- P397, bottom, The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?

## Thinking about life

- P399, top, _affective forecasting_
- P402, bottom, The essence of the focusing illusion, can be described as: _Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it._
- P406, top, _miswanting_: bad choices that arise from errors of affective forecasting.
