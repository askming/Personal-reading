## Introduction

- Financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and effort. That's true to some extent, and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I think more common), that financial success is not a hard science. It's a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.
- I love Voltaire's observation that "History never repeats itself; man always does."

## Chapter 1. No One's Crazy

- Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. So equally smart people can disagree about how and why recessions happen, how you should invest your money, what you should prioritize, how much risk you should take, and so on.
- As investor Michael Batnick says, "some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood." We are all victims, in different ways, to that truth.

## Chapter 2 Luck & Risk

- NYU professor Scott Galloway has a related idea that is so important to remember when judging success--both your own and others: "Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems."

- Two things can put you in a better direction
  - Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.
  - Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.

## Chapter 3 Never Enough

- The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving
- Social comparison is the problem here
- Enough is not too little
- There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain

- Happiness, as it's said, is just results minus expectations.

## Chapter 5 Getting Wealthy vs Staying Wealthy

- There are two reasons why a survival mentality is so key with
money.
  - One is the obvious: few gains are so great that they're worth
wiping yourself out over.
  - The other is the counterintuitive math of compounding

- Applying the survival mindset to the real world comes down to
appreciating three things.
  1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I'm unbreakable I actually think I'll get the biggest returns, because I'll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.
  2. Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.
  3. A barbelled personality--optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future-is vital.

- Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they
were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly
right.
