## Introduction

### It's not a promotion, it's a career change
- once you've been doing it for a while, you'll realize that the best managers let their team make the decisions. Sure, they act as a tiebreaker every now and again, but their team should be driving things.
- Associating management with higher compensation is a classic trap companies fall into. It changes all the incentives for individual contributors (ICs) who want to further their careers.

- At its heart, management is an act of service. 
- So why become a manager?
  - Finding joy in the leverage of a high-performing team
  - Finding joy in your team's personal growth.

- The paradox of management is that the attitude that got you to that position isn‚Äôt the attitude that will make you successful at it.

- management is tactical and leadership is strategic.
  - Management requires dealing with the day-to-day realities of hiring and aligning people, such as one-on-ones, performance reviews, planning meetings, goal check-ins, etc. Leadership means looking forward, compounding value, connecting dots, taking cues from outside the organization, and talking to customers to come up with a vision that you can communicate to the rest of the company.
