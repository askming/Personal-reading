_Some reading notes:_

- The first principle is to compete vigorously and with passion in the face of uncertainty and intimidation.
- One reflection, a second principle is simple the importance of putting your team first, ahead of your personal statistics and recognition
- There are of course many lessons and principles one can take from cricket, but for me a third is the central importance of leadership
- I think that is perhaps the number one thing that leaders have to do: to bolster the confidence of the people you're leading.
- Leadership means making choices and then rallying the team around the choices.
- Any institution-building comes from having a clear vision and culture that works to motivate progress both top-down and bottom-up.
- A leader must see the external opportunities and the internal capability and culture -- and all of the connections among them -- and respond to them before they become obvious parts fo the conventional wisdom.
- Culture is made up of acts that become habitual and accrue to something coherent and meaningful.
- A leader has to have an idea what to do -- to innovate in the face of fear and inertia.
- The first is to bring clarity to those you work with.
- Second, leaders generate energy, not only on their own teams but across the company .
- Third, and finally, they find a way to deliver success, to make things happen.
