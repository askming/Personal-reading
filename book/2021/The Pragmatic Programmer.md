## 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy

- ðŸ’¡ Tips
  - Itâ€™s Your Life
  - You Have Agency
  - Provide Options, Donâ€™t Make Lame Excuses
  - Donâ€™t Live with Broken Windows
  - Be a Catalyst for Change
  - Remember the Big Picture
  - Make Quality a Requirements Issue
  - Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
  - Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
  - English is Just Another Programming Language
  - Itâ€™s Both What You Say and the Way You Say It
  - Build Documentation In, Donâ€™t Bolt It On

- **_Software entropy_,** "software rot" or "technical debt", when disorder increases in software
- **_Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs_**, "start-up fatigue":  You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. The entire system just appears before your eyesâ€”you know itâ€™s right. But ask permission to tackle the whole thing and youâ€™ll be met with delays and blank stares. People will form committees, budgets will need approval, and things will get complicated. Everyone will guard their own resources.
- **_Your Knowledge Portfolio_**
   > An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest. -- Benjamin Franklin
  - "expiring assets": assents whose value diminishes over time
  - Guidelines for investment also apply to building knowledge portfolio
    - Invest regularly
    - Diversify
    - Manage risk
    - Buy low, sell high: Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding.
    - Review and rebalance
  - Goals
    - Learn at least one new language every year
    - Read a technical book each month
    - Read nontechnical books, too
    - Take classes
    - Participate in local user groups and meetups
    - Experiment with different environments
    - Stay current
  - _**Communicate!**_
      > The meaning of your communication is the response you get
