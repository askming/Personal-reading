## Chapter 3 Defining and Generating Sleep: Time Dilation
- P39, bottom, The thalamus is the sensory gate of the brain. It decides which sensory signals are allowed through its gate, and which are not.
- P39-40, Two universal indicators that offer a convincing conclusion of sleep:
  - First is the loss of external awareness - you stop perceiving the outside world.
  - The second feature that instructs your own, self-determined judgement of sleep is a sense of time distortion experienced in two contradictory ways.
 - P41, bottom, the gold-standard scientific verification of sleep requires the recording of signals, using electrodes, arising from three different regions: (1) brainwave activity, (2) eye movement activity, and (3) muscle activities. --> polysomnography (PSG) 
 - P49, middle, _sleep spindle_—a punchy burst of brainwave activity that often festoons the tail end of each individual slow wave. Sleep spindles occur during both the deep and the lighter stages of NREM sleep, even before the slow, powerful brainwaves of deep sleep start to rise up and dominate. One of their many functions is to operate like nocturnal soldiers who protect sleep by shielding the brain from external noises. The more powerful and frequent an individual’s sleep spindles, the more resilient they are to external noises that would otherwise awaken the sleeper.
 - P51, top, in deep NREM sleep, we fall into its default model of functioning, That default model is called _deep slow-wave
sleep_. It is an active, deliberate, but highly synchronous state of brain activity. It is a near state of nocturnal cerebral meditation, though I should note that it is very different from the brainwave activity of waking meditative states.
- P52, top, We therefore consider waking brainwave activity as that principally concerned with the _reception_ of the outside sensory world, while the state of deep NREM slow-wave sleep donates a state of inward _reflection_—one that fosters information transfer and the distillation of memories.
- P52, bottom, REM sleep has also been called _paradoxical sleep_: a brain that appears awake, yet a body that is clearly asleep.
- P53, middle, When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as _reception_ (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as _reflection_ (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as _integration_ (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).

## Chapter 4 Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

- P58, top, there are truly remarkable differences in sleep from one species to another. Four such differences
  1. _Total amount of time_. 
      - the relationship b/t the size of the nervous system, the complexity of the nervous system, and total body mass appears to be a somewhat meaningful predictor. increasing brain complexity relative to body size resulting in greater sleeping amounts
      - (P59, bottom) For now, our most accurate estimate of why different species need different sleep amounts involves a complex hybrid of factors, such as dietary type (omnivore, herbivore, carnivore), predator/prey balance within a habitat, the presence and nature of a social network, metabolic rate, and nervous system complexity. 
      
  2. _Composition_ (P60, middle).
      - P63, middle, Sleep rebound after sleep deprivation; NREM and REM rebound at different times 
      - P64, top, That humans (and all other species) can never “sleep back” that which we have previously lost is one of the most important take-homes of this book, the saddening consequences of which I will describe in chapters 7 and 8.
      
  3. _The way in which we all do it_. (P64, top)
      - P64, top, Take cetaceans, such as dolphins and whales, for example. Their sleep, of which there is only NREM, can be unihemispheric, meaning they will sleep with half a brain at a time! 
      - P65, 2nd, The gift of split-brain deep NREM sleep is not entirely unique to aquatic mammals. Birds can do it, too. However, there is a somewhat different, though equally life-preserving, reason: it allows them to keep an eye on things, quite literally.
      - P65, bottom, Two recently published reports suggest humans have a very mild version of unihemispheric sleep—one that is drawn out for similar reasons.
      - P66, middle, REM sleep is strangely immune to being split across sides of the brain, no matter who you are. 

  4. _Sleep pattern_. (P66, bottom)
      - P66, bottom, The infrequent situation happens only in response to extreme environmental pressures or challenges. Starvation is one example.

- P69, m, The practice of biphasic sleep is not cultural in origin, however. It is deeply biological. All humans, irrespective of culture or geographical location, have a genetically hardwired dip in alertness that occurs in the midafternoon hours.
- P69, b, post-prandial alertness dip (from the Latin _prandium_, “meal”).
- P70, b, the true pattern of biphasic sleep—for which there is anthropological, biological, and genetic evidence, and which remains measurable in all human beings to date—is one consisting of a longer bout of continuous sleep at night, followed by a shorter midafternoon nap.

- P72, 2nd, As it turns out, we humans are special when it comes to sleep. Compared to Old- and New- World monkeys, as well as apes, such as chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas, human sleep sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb. 
- P73, 2nd, _Homo erectus_, the predecessor of _Homo sapiens_, was the first obligate biped, walking freely upright on two legs. We believe that _Homo erectus_ was also the first dedicated ground sleeper.

- P74, 2nd, I offer a theorem: the tree-to-ground reengineering of sleep was a key trigger that rocketed Homo sapiens to the top of evolution’s lofty pyramid. At least two features define human beings relative to other primates.
    1. our degree of sociocultural complexity
    2. our cognitive intelligence. 
    - To the first of these points, we have discovered that REM sleep exquisitely recalibrates and fine-tunes the emotional circuits of the human brain (discussed in detail in part 3 of the book). 
      - Related, the REM-sleep gift of facilitating accurate recognition and comprehension allows us to make more intelligent decisions and actions as a consequence. 
      - Second, and more critical, if you multiply these individual benefits within and across groups and tribes, all of which are experiencing an ever-increasing intensity and richness of REM sleep over millennia, we can start to see how this nightly REM-sleep recalibration of our emotional brains could have scaled rapidly and exponentially. 
      - I will go a step further and suggest that this is the most influential function of REM sleep in mammals, perhaps the most influential function of all types of sleep in all mammals, and even the most eminent advantage ever gifted by sleep in the annals of all planetary life.
    - The second evolutionary contribution that the REM-sleep dreaming state fuels is creativity.
