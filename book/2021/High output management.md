## Introduction

- DRAM: dynamic random access memories
- xiv, Companies today basically have two choices: Adapt or die.
- xiv, 3rd, rules of the new environment: 
  - First, everything happens faster. 
  - Second, anything that can be done will be done, if not by you, then by someone else. Let there be no misunderstanding: These changes lead to a less kind, less gentle, and less predictable workplace.
 - xiv, 4th, as a manager in such a workplace, you need to develop a _higher tolerance for disorder_.

- xv, 2nd, The motto I’m advocating is “Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos.”

- xvi, 3rd, the single most important sentence of this book: _**The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence.**_

- xvii, 2nd, You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.

## 1 The Basics of Production: Delivering a Breakfast

- P6, Process, assembly, and test operations can be readily applied to other very different kinds of productive work.
- P10, first, equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory can be traded off against each other and then balanced against delivery time.
- P10, 2nd, Because each alternative costs money, your task is to find the most cost-effective way to deploy your resources—the key to optimizing all types of productive work.
- P11, 2nd, _functional_ vs _in-process test_ (e.g. simply insert a thermometer into the water so that the temperature could be easily and frequently checked. )
- P12, 2nd, _incoming_ or _receiving inspection_: e.g. look at the eggs at the time of receipt, 
- P12, 2nd, Besides the cost of the raw material and the cost of money, you should also try to gauge the opportunity at risk: what would it cost if you had to shut your egg machine down for a day? How many customers would you lose? How much would it cost to lure them back? Such questions define the opportunity at risk.

## 2 Managing the Breakfast Factory

- P17, 2nd, _pairing indicators_, with what both effect and counter-effect are measured (e.g. inventory levels and the incidence of shortages).
- P17, 4th, Nowhere can indicators—and paired indicators—be of more help than in administrative work.
- P17, b, genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. It should be  should be a physical, countable thing. 

- ![00007](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5671771/147892735-72479510-41bc-4a7e-8e37-4abceba1f80c.jpeg)
  _By peering through the windows in the black box, we can get an idea of what the future output is likely to be._

- P20-22
  - _Leading indicators_: give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like. 
  - _Linear indicators_: A generally applicable example of a “window” cut into the black box; the linearity indicator flashes an early warning, allowing us time to take corrective action. Without it, we would discover that we had missed our target in June, when nothing can be done about it.
  - _Trend indicators_: These show output (breakfasts delivered, software modules completed, vouchers processed) measured against time (performance this month versus performance over a series of previous months), and also against some standard or expected level.

- P22, b, stagger chart: which forecasts an output over the next several months.
   - ![00009](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5671771/147892798-2013b075-6829-42b1-9498-02928ba89c6d.jpeg)

- P24, last, There are two ways to control the output of any factory. Some industries _build to order_; another is  _build to forecast,_ which is a contemplation of future orders

- P28, last, In the language of production, the lowest-value-point inspection where we inspect raw material is called _incoming material inspection_ or _receiving inspection_.
  - If we again use a black box to represent our production process, inspections that occur at intervening points within it are called, logically enough, _in-process inspections_.
  - Finally, the last possible point of inspection, when the product is ready to be shipped to the customer, is called _final inspection_ or _outgoing quality inspection_. 

- P30, 3rd, There is a _gate-like inspection_ and a _monitoring_ step.
  - In the former, all material is held at the “gate” until the inspection tests are completed.
  - In the latter, a sample of the material is taken, and if it fails, a notation is made from which a failure rate is calculated. The bulk of the material is not held as the sample is taken but continues to move through the manufacturing process.

- P31, 2nd, Another way to lower the cost of quality assurance is to use _variable inspections_. Because quality levels vary over time, it is only common sense to vary how often we inspect.

- P33, 3rd, The productivity of any function occurring within it is the output divided by the labor required to generate the output. 

- P35, 2nd, _leverage_, the output generated by a specific type of work activity.
  - An activity with high leverage will generate a high level of output; an activity with low leverage, a low level of output.
  - Automation is certainly one way to improve the leverage of all types of work. Having machines to help them, human beings can create more output. But in both widget manufacturing and administrative work, something else can also increase the productivity of the black box. This is called _work simplification_.

## 3 Managerial Leverage

- P40, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5671771/147893089-3c01e66d-ad10-4a74-82ec-0cc311d79cc0.png)

- P40, 2nd, If the manager is a knowledge specialist, a _know-how manager_, his potential for influencing “neighboring” organizations is enormous.
- P47, 1st, Like a housewife’s, a manager’s work is never done. There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done.
- P49, 2nd, To improve and maintain your capacity to get information, you have to understand the way it comes to you.
- P50, 2nd, transmitting objectives and preferred approaches constitutes a key to successful delegation.
- P51, 3rd, information-gathering is the basis of all other managerial work, which is why I choose to spend so much of my day doing it.
- P54, Managerial productivity—that is, the output of a manager per unit of time worked—can be increased in three ways:
  1.  Increasing the rate with which a manager performs his activities, speeding up his work.
  2.  Increasing the leverage associated with the various managerial activities.
  3.  Shifting the mix of a manager’s activities from those with lower to those with higher leverage.

- P54, high-leverage activities can be achieved in three basic ways:
  - When many people are affected by one manager.
  - When a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a manager’s brief, well-focused set of words or actions.
  - When a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge or information.

- P58, The art of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them. For me, paying close attention to customer complaints constitutes a high-leverage activity. 

- P60, 2nd, delegation without follow-through is _abdication_. 
- P61, 1st, A second principle applies to the frequency with which you check your subordinates’ work. 
  - How often you monitor should not be based on what you believe your subordinate can do in general, but on his experience with a specific task and his prior performance with it—his task-relevant maturity

- P62, 2nd, the most obvious way to increase managerial output is to increase the rate, or speed, of performing work.
- P64, 4th, It is important to say “no” earlier rather than later because we’ve learned that to wait until something reaches a higher value stage and then abort due to lack of capacity means losing more money and time. 

- P65, 2nd-4th,
  - The next production principle you can apply is to allow slack—a bit of looseness in your scheduling. 
  - Another production principle is very nearly the opposite. 
  - A final principle. Most production practices follow well-established procedures and, rather than reinventing the wheel repeatedly, use a specific method that has been shown to work before. 

- P66, 2nd, a manager should allocate about a half day per week to each of his subordinates. (Two days a week per subordinate would probably lead to meddling; an hour a week does not provide enough opportunity for monitoring.)
- P70, 2nd, channel the time needed to deal with them into organized, scheduled form by providing an alternative to interruption—a scheduled meeting or an office hour.
- P70, The point is to impose a pattern on the way a manager copes with problems. To make something regular that was once irregular is a fundamental production principle, and that’s how you should try to handle the interruptions that plague you.

## 4 Meetings—The Medium of Managerial Work

- P71, 2nd, meeting is nothing less than the _medium_ through which managerial work is performed. 
- P72, 1st, The two basic managerial roles produce two basic kinds of meetings. In the first kind of meeting, called a _process-oriented meeting_, knowledge is shared and information is exchanged. Such meetings take place on a regularly scheduled basis. The purpose of the second kind of meeting is to solve a specific problem. Meetings of this sort, called _mission-oriented_, frequently produce a decision. They are ad hoc affairs, not scheduled long in advance, because they usually can’t be.
- P75, 2nd, A key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the _subordinate’s meeting_, with its agenda and tone set by him. 

- P75, 3rd, What should be covered in a one-on-one?
  - We can start with performance figures, indicators used by the subordinate, such as incoming order rates, production output, or project status.
  - The meeting should also cover anything important that has happened since the last meeting: current hiring problems, people problems in general, organizational problems and future plans, and—very, very important—_potential_ problems.

- P76, 3rd, mechanical hints for effective one-on-one meetings. 
  - First, both the supervisor and subordinate should have a copy of the outline and both should take notes on it, which serves a number of purposes.
  - The supervisor should also encourage the discussion of heart-to-heart issues during one-on-ones, because this is the perfect forum for getting at subtle and deep work-related problems affecting his subordinate.

- P77, 3rd, One-on-ones should be scheduled on a rolling basis—setting up the next one as the meeting taking place ends. 
- P80, 3rd, Staff meetings should be mostly controlled, with an agenda issued far enough in advance that the subordinates will have had the chance to prepare their thoughts for the meeting. But it should also include an “open session”—a designated period of time for the staff to bring up anything they want. 
- P80, 4th, A supervisor should never use staff meetings to pontificate, which is the surest way to undermine free discussion and hence the meeting’s basic purpose.
  - supervisor’s most important roles are being a meeting’s moderator and facilitator, and controller of its pace and thrust. 

- P84, 3rd, for mission-oriented meetings, the chairman must have a clear understanding of the meeting’s objective—what needs to happen and what decision has to be made. The absolute truth is that if you don’t know what you want, you won’t get it. So before calling a meeting, ask yourself: What am I trying to accomplish? Then ask, is a meeting necessary? Or desirable? Or justifiable? Don’t call a meeting if all the answers aren’t yes.

## 5 Decisions, Decisions

- P88, 2nd, authority (to make decisions) went with responsibility (position in the management hierarchy). 
- P88, b, a rapid divergence develops between power based on position and power based on knowledge, which occurs because the base of knowledge that constitutes the foundation of the business changes rapidly.
- P89, 3rd, The key to success is again the middle manager, who not only is a link in the chain of command but also can see to it that the holders of the two types of power mesh smoothly.
- P90, ![00017](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5671771/147894080-46844ccb-fca6-4b87-bb6b-56ff27a49ec1.jpeg)
  _The ideal decision-making process._
 
- P91, 3rd, an organization does not live by its members agreeing with one another at all times about everything. It lives instead by people committing to support the decisions and the moves of the business. All a manager can expect is that the commitment to support is honestly present, and this is something he can and must get from everyone.

- P92, 2nd, Another desirable and important feature of the model is that any decision be worked out and reached at the _lowest competent level_. 
  - ideally, decision-making should occur in the middle ground, between reliance on technical knowledge on the one hand, and on the bruises one has received from having tried to implement and apply such knowledge on the other. 

- P93, 3rd, The most common problem is something we call the _peer-group syndrome_. 
  - _peer-plus-one approach_ is used to aid decision-making where we must. Peers tend to look for a more senior manager, even if he is not the most competent or knowledgeable person involved, to take over and shape a meeting.

- P95, 4th, One thing that paralyzes both knowledge and position power possessors is the fear of simply _sounding dumb_.
- P95, last,  related phenomenon influences lower-level people present in the meeting. This group has to overcome the fear of _being overruled_, which might mean embarrassment: if the rest of the group or a senior-level manager vetoed a junior person or opposed a position he was advocating, the junior manager might lose face in front of his peers.

- P97, 2nd, If you either enter the decision-making stage too early or wait too long, you won’t derive the full benefit of open discussion. The criterion to follow is this: don’t push for a decision prematurely.
- P97, one of the manager’s key tasks is to settle six important questions in advance:
  - What decision needs to be made?
  - When does it have to be made?
  - Who will decide?
  - Who will need to be consulted prior to making the decision?
  - Who will ratify or veto the decision?
  - Who will need to be informed of the decision?
