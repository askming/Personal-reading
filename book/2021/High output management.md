## Introduction

- DRAM: dynamic random access memories
- xiv, Companies today basically have two choices: Adapt or die.
- xiv, 3rd, rules of the new environment: 
  - First, everything happens faster. 
  - Second, anything that can be done will be done, if not by you, then by someone else. Let there be no misunderstanding: These changes lead to a less kind, less gentle, and less predictable workplace.
 - xiv, 4th, as a manager in such a workplace, you need to develop a _higher tolerance for disorder_.

- xv, 2nd, The motto I’m advocating is “Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos.”

- xvi, 3rd, the single most important sentence of this book: _**The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence.**_

- xvii, 2nd, You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.

## 1 The Basics of Production: Delivering a Breakfast

- P6, Process, assembly, and test operations can be readily applied to other very different kinds of productive work.
- P10, first, equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory can be traded off against each other and then balanced against delivery time.
- P10, 2nd, Because each alternative costs money, your task is to find the most cost-effective way to deploy your resources—the key to optimizing all types of productive work.
- P11, 2nd, _functional_ vs _in-process test_ (e.g. simply insert a thermometer into the water so that the temperature could be easily and frequently checked. )
- P12, 2nd, _incoming_ or _receiving inspection_: e.g. look at the eggs at the time of receipt, 
- P12, 2nd, Besides the cost of the raw material and the cost of money, you should also try to gauge the opportunity at risk: what would it cost if you had to shut your egg machine down for a day? How many customers would you lose? How much would it cost to lure them back? Such questions define the opportunity at risk.

## 2 Managing the Breakfast Factory

- P17, 2nd, _pairing indicators_, with what both effect and counter-effect are measured (e.g. inventory levels and the incidence of shortages).
- P17, 4th, Nowhere can indicators—and paired indicators—be of more help than in administrative work.
- P17, b, genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. It should be  should be a physical, countable thing.

  _By peering through the windows in the black box, we can get an idea of what the future output is likely to be._

- P20-22
  - _Leading indicators_: give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like. 
  - _Linear indicators_: A generally applicable example of a “window” cut into the black box; the linearity indicator flashes an early warning, allowing us time to take corrective action. Without it, we would discover that we had missed our target in June, when nothing can be done about it.
  - _Trend indicators_: These show output (breakfasts delivered, software modules completed, vouchers processed) measured against time (performance this month versus performance over a series of previous months), and also against some standard or expected level.

- P22, b, stagger chart: which forecasts an output over the next several months.

- P24, last, There are two ways to control the output of any factory. Some industries _build to order_; another is  _build to forecast,_ which is a contemplation of future orders

- P28, last, In the language of production, the lowest-value-point inspection where we inspect raw material is called _incoming material inspection_ or _receiving inspection_.
  - If we again use a black box to represent our production process, inspections that occur at intervening points within it are called, logically enough, _in-process inspections_.
  - Finally, the last possible point of inspection, when the product is ready to be shipped to the customer, is called _final inspection_ or _outgoing quality inspection_. 

- P30, 3rd, There is a _gate-like inspection_ and a _monitoring_ step.
  - In the former, all material is held at the “gate” until the inspection tests are completed.
  - In the latter, a sample of the material is taken, and if it fails, a notation is made from which a failure rate is calculated. The bulk of the material is not held as the sample is taken but continues to move through the manufacturing process.

- P31, 2nd, Another way to lower the cost of quality assurance is to use _variable inspections_. Because quality levels vary over time, it is only common sense to vary how often we inspect.

- P33, 3rd, The productivity of any function occurring within it is the output divided by the labor required to generate the output. 

- P35, 2nd, _leverage_, the output generated by a specific type of work activity.
  - An activity with high leverage will generate a high level of output; an activity with low leverage, a low level of output.
  - Automation is certainly one way to improve the leverage of all types of work. Having machines to help them, human beings can create more output. But in both widget manufacturing and administrative work, something else can also increase the productivity of the black box. This is called _work simplification_.
