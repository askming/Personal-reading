## How judgements happen

- System 1 can't deal with sum-like variables effectively; it works well with averages

## Answering an easier question

- P97, bottom, the concept of substitution
- P98, top, the definition of heuristic

### characteristics of system 1

- generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by System 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions
- operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort, and no sense of voluntary control
- can be programmed by System 2 to mobilize attention when a particular pattern is detected (search)
- executes skilled responses and generates skilled intuitions, after adequate training
- creates a coherent pattern of activated ideas in associative memory
- links a sense of cognitive ease to illusions of truth, pleasant feelings, and reduced vigilance
- distinguishes the surprising from the normal
- infers and invents causes and intentions
- neglects ambiguity and suppresses doubt
- is biased to believe and confirm
- exaggerates emotional consistency (halo effect)
- focuses on existing evidence and ignores absent evidence (WYSIATI)
- generates a limited set of basic assessments
- represents sets by norms and prototypes, does not integrate
- matches intensities across scales (e.g., size to loudness) computes more than intended (mental shotgun)
- sometimes substitutes an easier question for a difficult one (heuristics)
- is more sensitive to changes than to states (prospect theory)
- overweights low probabilities
- shows diminishing sensitivity to quantity (psychophysics)
- responds more strongly to losses than to gains (loss aversion)
- frames decision problems narrowly, in isolation from one another

## The law of small numbers

- P112, middle, for a research psychologist, sampling variation is not a curiosity; it is a nuisance and a costly obstacle, which turns the undertaking of every research project into a gamble.

- P115, top, Instead of focusing on how the event at hand came to be, the statistical view relates it to what could have happened instead. Nothing in particular caused it to be what it is - chance selected it from among its alternatives.

- P116, bottom, there is no such a thing as hot hand in professional basketball - research showed. It's related with the tendency to see patterns in randomness.

## Availability, emotion, and risk

- P139, top, people form opinions and make choices that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or avoid, often without knowing that they are doing so. 
- The emotional tail wags the rational dog. Jonathan Haidt
- P142, top, the availability cascade

## Tom W's specialty

- Base rate vs detailed description
- impact of Representativeness in decision making
- P154, bottom, the essential keys to disciplined Bayesian reasoning can be simply summarized:
  - Anchor your judgement of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate
  - Question the diagnosticity of your evidence

## Linda: less is more

- P158, bottom, conjunction fallacy: people commit when they judge a conjunction of two events to be more probable than one of the events in a direct comparison

## Causes trump statistics

- P174, top, subject's unwillingness to deduce particular to general was matched only by willingness to infer the general from the particular. 
- P174, bottom, surprising individual cases have a powerful impact and are more effective tool for teaching psychology because the incongruity must be resolved and embedded in causal story.

## Regression to the mean

- P177, top, 
> success = talent + luck
> great success = a little more talent + a lot of luck
- P181, bottom, regression and correlation are not two concepts; whenever the correlation between two scores is imperfect, there will be regression to the mean

## Taming intuitive predictions

- P192, top, intuitive predictions tend to be overconfident and overly extreme. 
- Extreme predictions and willingness to predict rare events from rare evidence are both manifestations of System 1.

## The illusion of understanding

- P199, top, narrative fallacy
- P202, middle, once you adopt a new view of the world (out of any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed. 
- P203, bottom, outcome bias

## The illusion of validity

-  P211, bottom, the illusion of validity
- P212, middle, Subjective confidence in a juagment is not a reasoned evaluation of the probability that this judgment is correct. Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and cognitive ease of processing it. It is wise to take admissions of uncertainty seriously, but declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true.

- P218, 2nd paragraph, march of history
- P220, top, hedgehog vs fox analogy

## Intuitions Vs formulas

- Paul Meehl, clinical vs statistical prediction:a theoretical analysis and a review of the evidence
- P225, top, inconsistency in personal evaluation is typical, which may be the main reason that leads to bad performance in human prediction
- P225, middle, inconsistency is destructive of any predictive ability
