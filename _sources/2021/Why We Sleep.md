## Chapter 3 Defining and Generating Sleep: Time Dilation
- P39, bottom, The thalamus is the sensory gate of the brain. It decides which sensory signals are allowed through its gate, and which are not.
- P39-40, Two universal indicators that offer a convincing conclusion of sleep:
  - First is the loss of external awareness - you stop perceiving the outside world.
  - The second feature that instructs your own, self-determined judgement of sleep is a sense of time distortion experienced in two contradictory ways.
 - P41, bottom, the gold-standard scientific verification of sleep requires the recording of signals, using electrodes, arising from three different regions: (1) brainwave activity, (2) eye movement activity, and (3) muscle activities. --> polysomnography (PSG) 
 - P49, middle, _sleep spindle_—a punchy burst of brainwave activity that often festoons the tail end of each individual slow wave. Sleep spindles occur during both the deep and the lighter stages of NREM sleep, even before the slow, powerful brainwaves of deep sleep start to rise up and dominate. One of their many functions is to operate like nocturnal soldiers who protect sleep by shielding the brain from external noises. The more powerful and frequent an individual’s sleep spindles, the more resilient they are to external noises that would otherwise awaken the sleeper.
 - P51, top, in deep NREM sleep, we fall into its default model of functioning, That default model is called _deep slow-wave
sleep_. It is an active, deliberate, but highly synchronous state of brain activity. It is a near state of nocturnal cerebral meditation, though I should note that it is very different from the brainwave activity of waking meditative states.
- P52, top, We therefore consider waking brainwave activity as that principally concerned with the _reception_ of the outside sensory world, while the state of deep NREM slow-wave sleep donates a state of inward _reflection_—one that fosters information transfer and the distillation of memories.
- P52, bottom, REM sleep has also been called _paradoxical sleep_: a brain that appears awake, yet a body that is clearly asleep.
- P53, middle, When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as _reception_ (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as _reflection_ (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as _integration_ (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).
