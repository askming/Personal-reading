## Chapter 3 Defining and Generating Sleep: Time Dilation
- P39, bottom, The thalamus is the sensory gate of the brain. It decides which sensory signals are allowed through its gate, and which are not.
- P39-40, Two universal indicators that offer a convincing conclusion of sleep:
  - First is the loss of external awareness - you stop perceiving the outside world.
  - The second feature that instructs your own, self-determined judgement of sleep is a sense of time distortion experienced in two contradictory ways.
 - P41, bottom, the gold-standard scientific verification of sleep requires the recording of signals, using electrodes, arising from three different regions: (1) brainwave activity, (2) eye movement activity, and (3) muscle activities. --> polysomnography (PSG) 
 - P49, middle, _sleep spindle_—a punchy burst of brainwave activity that often festoons the tail end of each individual slow wave. Sleep spindles occur during both the deep and the lighter stages of NREM sleep, even before the slow, powerful brainwaves of deep sleep start to rise up and dominate. One of their many functions is to operate like nocturnal soldiers who protect sleep by shielding the brain from external noises. The more powerful and frequent an individual’s sleep spindles, the more resilient they are to external noises that would otherwise awaken the sleeper.
 - P51, top, in deep NREM sleep, we fall into its default model of functioning, That default model is called _deep slow-wave
sleep_. It is an active, deliberate, but highly synchronous state of brain activity. It is a near state of nocturnal cerebral meditation, though I should note that it is very different from the brainwave activity of waking meditative states.
- P52, top, We therefore consider waking brainwave activity as that principally concerned with the _reception_ of the outside sensory world, while the state of deep NREM slow-wave sleep donates a state of inward _reflection_—one that fosters information transfer and the distillation of memories.
- P52, bottom, REM sleep has also been called _paradoxical sleep_: a brain that appears awake, yet a body that is clearly asleep.
- P53, middle, When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as _reception_ (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as _reflection_ (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as _integration_ (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).

## Chapter 4 Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

- P58, top, there are truly remarkable differences in sleep from one species to another. Four such differences
  1. _Total amount of time_. 
      - the relationship b/t the size of the nervous system, the complexity of the nervous system, and total body mass appears to be a somewhat meaningful predictor. increasing brain complexity relative to body size resulting in greater sleeping amounts
      - (P59, bottom) For now, our most accurate estimate of why different species need different sleep amounts involves a complex hybrid of factors, such as dietary type (omnivore, herbivore, carnivore), predator/prey balance within a habitat, the presence and nature of a social network, metabolic rate, and nervous system complexity. 
      
  2. _Composition_ (P60, middle).
      - P63, middle, Sleep rebound after sleep deprivation; NREM and REM rebound at different times 
      - P64, top, That humans (and all other species) can never “sleep back” that which we have previously lost is one of the most important take-homes of this book, the saddening consequences of which I will describe in chapters 7 and 8.
      
  3. _The way in which we all do it_. (P64, top)
      - P64, top, Take cetaceans, such as dolphins and whales, for example. Their sleep, of which there is only NREM, can be unihemispheric, meaning they will sleep with half a brain at a time! 
      - P65, 2nd, The gift of split-brain deep NREM sleep is not entirely unique to aquatic mammals. Birds can do it, too. However, there is a somewhat different, though equally life-preserving, reason: it allows them to keep an eye on things, quite literally.
      - P65, bottom, Two recently published reports suggest humans have a very mild version of unihemispheric sleep—one that is drawn out for similar reasons.
      - P66, middle, REM sleep is strangely immune to being split across sides of the brain, no matter who you are. 

  4. _Sleep pattern_. (P66, bottom)
      - P66, bottom, The infrequent situation happens only in response to extreme environmental pressures or challenges. Starvation is one example.

- P69, m, The practice of biphasic sleep is not cultural in origin, however. It is deeply biological. All humans, irrespective of culture or geographical location, have a genetically hardwired dip in alertness that occurs in the midafternoon hours.
- P69, b, post-prandial alertness dip (from the Latin _prandium_, “meal”).
- P70, b, the true pattern of biphasic sleep—for which there is anthropological, biological, and genetic evidence, and which remains measurable in all human beings to date—is one consisting of a longer bout of continuous sleep at night, followed by a shorter midafternoon nap.

- P72, 2nd, As it turns out, we humans are special when it comes to sleep. Compared to Old- and New- World monkeys, as well as apes, such as chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas, human sleep sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb. 
- P73, 2nd, _Homo erectus_, the predecessor of _Homo sapiens_, was the first obligate biped, walking freely upright on two legs. We believe that _Homo erectus_ was also the first dedicated ground sleeper.

- P74, 2nd, I offer a theorem: the tree-to-ground reengineering of sleep was a key trigger that rocketed Homo sapiens to the top of evolution’s lofty pyramid. At least two features define human beings relative to other primates.
    1. our degree of sociocultural complexity
    2. our cognitive intelligence. 
    - To the first of these points, we have discovered that REM sleep exquisitely recalibrates and fine-tunes the emotional circuits of the human brain (discussed in detail in part 3 of the book). 
      - Related, the REM-sleep gift of facilitating accurate recognition and comprehension allows us to make more intelligent decisions and actions as a consequence. 
      - Second, and more critical, if you multiply these individual benefits within and across groups and tribes, all of which are experiencing an ever-increasing intensity and richness of REM sleep over millennia, we can start to see how this nightly REM-sleep recalibration of our emotional brains could have scaled rapidly and exponentially. 
      - I will go a step further and suggest that this is the most influential function of REM sleep in mammals, perhaps the most influential function of all types of sleep in all mammals, and even the most eminent advantage ever gifted by sleep in the annals of all planetary life.
    - The second evolutionary contribution that the REM-sleep dreaming state fuels is creativity.

## Chapter 5 Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span

### Sleep before birth

- P79, b, Detailed creation of the brain and its component parts occurs at a rapid pace during the second and third trimesters of human development—precisely the time window when REM-sleep amounts skyrocket. 
  - REM sleep acts as an electrical fertilizer during this critical phase of early life. Dazzling bursts of electrical activity during REM sleep stimulate the lush growth of neural pathways all over the developing brain, and then furnish each with a healthy bouquet of connecting ends, or synaptic terminals. 
- P80, top, This phase of development, which infuses the brain with masses of neural connections, is called _synaptogenesis_, as it involves the creation of millions of wiring links, or synapses, between neurons. 
- **ASD**: autism spectrum disorder; **ADHD**: attention deficit hyper-activity disorder
- P81, b, sleep of individuals with autism is atypical.
  - Infants and young children who show signs of autism, or who are diagnosed with autism, do not have normal sleep patterns or amounts. The circadian rhythms of autistic children are also weaker than their non-autistic counterparts, showing a flatter profile of melatonin across the twenty-four-hour period rather than a powerful rise in concentration at night and rapid fall throughout the day
  - Most notable, however, is the significant shortage of REM sleep. Autistic individuals show a 30 to 50 percent deficit in the amount of REM sleep they obtain, relative to children without autism.
- P82, m, Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep that we know of.
  - P83, t, Newborns of heavy-drinking mothers did not have the same electrical quality of REM sleep.
  - P83, t, the infants of heavy-drinking mothers showed a 200 percent reduction in this measure of vibrant electrical activity relative to the infants born of non-alcohol-consuming mothers. 

### Childhood Sleep

- P87, t, During the fourteen hours of total shut-eye per day that a six-month-old infant obtains, there is a 50/50 timeshare between NREM and REM sleep. A five-year-old, however, will have a 70/30 split between NREM and REM sleep across the eleven hours of total daily slumber. In other words, the proportion of REM sleep decreases in early childhood while the proportion of NREM sleep actually increases, even though total sleep time decreases.
  - The downgrading of the REM-sleep portion, and the upswing in NREM-sleep dominance, continues, throughout early and midchildhood. That balance will finally stabilize to an 80/20 NREM/REM sleep split by the late teen years, and remain so throughout early and midadulthood.

### Sleep and adolescence

- P88, 3rd, The human brain undergoes a similar, use-determined transformation during late childhood and adolescence. Much of the original structure laid down early in life will persist, since Mother Nature has, by now, learned to create a quite accurate first-pass wiring of a brain after billions of attempts over many thousands of years of evolution. 
  - The unique experiences of a child during their formative years translate to a set of personal usage statistics. Those experiences, or those statistics, provide the bespoke blueprint for a last round of brain refinement, capitalizing on the opportunity left open by nature. A (somewhat) generic brain becomes ever more individualized, based on the personalized use of the owner.
  - P89, t, To help with the job of refinement and downscaling of connectivity, the brain employs the services of deep NREM sleep. Of the many functions carried out by deep NREM sleep—the full roster of which we will discuss in the next chapter—it is that of synaptic pruning that features prominently during adolescence.

- P90, 2nd, The changes in deep NREM sleep always precede the cognitive and developmental milestones within the brain by several weeks or months, implying a direction of influence: _deep sleep may be a driving force of brain maturation, not the other way around._
- Feinberg's second seminal discovery.
  - the rise- and-fall pattern of maturation always began at the back of the brain, which performs the functions of visual and spatial perception, and then progressed steadily forward as adolescence progressed. Most striking, the very last stop on the maturational journey was the tip of the frontal lobe, which enables rational thinking and critical decision-making. Therefore, the back of the brain of an adolescent was more adult-like, while the front of the brain remained more child-like at any one moment during this developmental window of time.
- Adolescents face two other harmful challenges in their struggle to obtain sufficient sleep as their brains continue to develop. 
  1. The first is a change in their circadian rhythm.
    -Adolescent teenagers have a different circadian rhythm from their young siblings. By the time an individual has reached sixteen years of age, their circadian rhythm has undergone a dramatic shift forward in its cycling phase. The rising tide of melatonin, and the instruction of darkness and sleep, is many hours away (to a much later time in the night). 
  2. The second is early school start times.

### Sleep in midlife and old age

- P95, b, That older adults simply need less sleep is a myth. Older adults appear to need just as much sleep as they do in midlife, but are simply less able to generate that (still necessary) sleep.
- P95, b, core impairments of sleep that occur with aging are due to three key changes: (1) reduced quantity/quality, (2) reduced sleep efficiency, and (3) disrupted timing of sleep.
  - As you enter your fourth decade of life, there is a palpable reduction in the electrical quantity and quality of that deep NREM sleep. You obtain fewer hours of deep sleep, and those deep NREM brainwaves become smaller, less powerful, and fewer in number. Passing into your mid- and late forties, age will have stripped you of 60 to 70 percent of the deep sleep you were enjoying as a young teenager. By the time you reach seventy years old, you will have lost 80 to 90 percent of your youthful deep sleep.
  - The older we get, the more frequently we wake up throughout the night. There are many causes, including interacting medications and diseases, but chief among them is a weakened bladder.
  - _sleep efficiency_, defined as the percent of time you were asleep while in bed. 
    - As healthy teenagers, we enjoyed a sleep efficiency of about 95 percent. As a reference anchor, most sleep doctors consider good-quality sleep to involve a sleep efficiency of 90 percent or above. By the time we reach our eighties, sleep efficiency has often dropped below 70 or 80 percent
    - the lower an older individual’s sleep efficiency score, the higher their mortality risk, the worse their physical health, the more likely they are to suffer from depression, the less energy they report, and the lower their cognitive function, typified by forgetfulness
  - In sharp contrast to adolescents, seniors commonly experience a regression in sleep timing, leading to earlier and earlier bedtimes.

- P100, b, The change in circadian rhythm as we get older, together with more frequent trips to the bathroom, help to explain two of the three key nighttime issues in the elderly: early sleep onset/offset and sleep fragmentation. They do not, however, explain the first key change in sleep with advancing age: the loss of deep-sleep quantity and quality.
  - First, the areas of the brain that suffer the most dramatic deterioration with aging are, unfortunately, the very same deep-sleep-generating regions—the middle-frontal regions seated above the bridge of the nose
  - Second, and unsurprisingly, older adults suffered a 70 percent loss of deep sleep, compared with matched young individuals.
  - Third, and most critical, we discovered that these changes were not independent, but instead significantly connected with one another: the more severe the deterioration that an older adult suffers within this specific mid-frontal region of their brain, the more dramatic their loss of deep NREM sleep.

## Chapter 6 Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew

- P108, b, Of the many advantages conferred by sleep on the brain, that of memory is especially impressive, and particularly well understood. Sleep has proven itself time and again as a memory aid: both before learning, to prepare your brain for initially making new memories, and after learning, to cement those memories and prevent forgetting.

### Sleep-the-night-before learning

- P109, 2nd, A long, finger-shaped structure tucked deep on either side of your brain, the hippocampus offers a short-term reservoir, or temporary information store, for accumulating new memories. 
  - Unfortunately, the hippocampus has a limited storage capacity, almost like a USB memory stick. 
  - Exceed its capacity and you run the risk of not being able to add more information or, equally bad, overwriting one memory with another: a mishap called _interference forgetting_.

- P110, 3rd, The memory refreshment was related to lighter, stage 2 NREM sleep, and specifically the short, powerful bursts of electrical activity called **sleep spindles**.
  - The more sleep spindles an individual obtained during the nap, the greater the restoration of their learning when they woke up.
  - Importantly, sleep spindles did not predict someone’s innate learning aptitude. That would be a less interesting result, as it would imply that inherent learning ability and spindles simply go hand in hand. Instead, it was specifically the _change in learning_ from before relative to after sleep, which is to say the replenishment of learning ability, that spindles predicted.

- P111, 3rd, We have found that seniors (aged sixty to eighty years old) are unable to generate sleep spindles to the same degree as young, healthy adults, suffering a 40 percent deficit.
  - We conducted the study, and that is precisely what we found: the fewer the number of spindles an elderly brain produced on a particular night, the lower the learning capacity of that older individual the next day, making it more difficult for them to memorize the list of facts we presented.

- P112, t, Of broader societal relevance, the concentration of NREM-sleep spindles is especially rich in the late-morning hours, sandwiched between long periods of REM sleep. 

### Sleep-the-night-after learning

- P112, 2nd, The second benefit of sleep for memory comes after learning, one that effectively clicks the “save” button on those newly created files. In doing so, sleep protects newly acquired information, affording immunity against forgetting: an operation called **consolidation.**
- P113, b, It was early-night sleep, rich in deep NREM, that won out in terms of providing superior memory retention savings relative to late-night, REM-rich sleep.
- P114, 3rd, We had observed a real-estate transaction that takes place each night when we sleep. Fitting the notion of a long-wave radio signal that carries information across large geographical distances, the slow brainwaves of deep NREM had served as a courier service, transporting memory packets from a temporary storage hold (hippocampus) to a more secure, permanent home (the cortex). In doing so, sleep had helped future-proof those memories.
- P116, 2nd, Not only does sleep maintain those memories you have successfully learned before bed (“the vision that was planted in my brain / Still remains”), but it will even salvage those that appeared to have been lost soon after learning. 
- P117, footnote, tDCS: trans cranial direct current brain stimulation
- P119, t, You can (via some means) selectively enhanced only those individual memories that you want to keep. It all sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but it is now science fact: the method is called **targeted memory reactivation**.

### Sleep to forget?

- P121, b,  Instead, sleep is able to offer a far more discerning hand in memory improvement: one that preferentially picks and chooses what information is, and is not, ultimately strengthened. Sleep accomplishes this by using meaningful tags that have been hung onto those memories during initial learning, or potentially identified during sleep itself. 

### Sleep for other types of memory

- P127, 2nd, Indeed, it was the number of those wonderful sleep spindles in the last two hours of the late morning—the time of night with the richest spindle bursts of brainwave activity—that were linked with the offline memory boost.
- P127, 3rd, When it comes to motor-skill memories, the brainwaves of sleep were acting like a good masseuse—you still get a full body massage, but they will place special focus on areas of the body that need the most help. In the same way, sleep spindles bathe all parts of the brain, but a disproportionate emphasis will be placed on those parts of the brain that have been worked hardest with learning during the day.

### Sleep for creativity

- P132, 2nd, If you ponder the type of conscious experience such outlandish memory blending would produce, you may not be surprised to learn that it happens during the dreaming state—REM sleep
