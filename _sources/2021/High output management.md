## Introduction

- DRAM: dynamic random access memories
- xiv, Companies today basically have two choices: Adapt or die.
- xiv, 3rd, rules of the new environment: 
  - First, everything happens faster. 
  - Second, anything that can be done will be done, if not by you, then by someone else. Let there be no misunderstanding: These changes lead to a less kind, less gentle, and less predictable workplace.
 - xiv, 4th, as a manager in such a workplace, you need to develop a _higher tolerance for disorder_.

- xv, 2nd, The motto I’m advocating is “Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos.”

- xvi, 3rd, the single most important sentence of this book: _**The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence.**_

- xvii, 2nd, You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.

## 1 The Basics of Production: Delivering a Breakfast

- P6, Process, assembly, and test operations can be readily applied to other very different kinds of productive work.
- P10, first, equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory can be traded off against each other and then balanced against delivery time.
- P10, 2nd, Because each alternative costs money, your task is to find the most cost-effective way to deploy your resources—the key to optimizing all types of productive work.
- P11, 2nd, _functional_ vs _in-process test_ (e.g. simply insert a thermometer into the water so that the temperature could be easily and frequently checked. )
- P12, 2nd, _incoming_ or _receiving inspection_: e.g. look at the eggs at the time of receipt, 
- P12, 2nd, Besides the cost of the raw material and the cost of money, you should also try to gauge the opportunity at risk: what would it cost if you had to shut your egg machine down for a day? How many customers would you lose? How much would it cost to lure them back? Such questions define the opportunity at risk.

## 2 Managing the Breakfast Factory

- P17, 2nd, _pairing indicators_, with what both effect and counter-effect are measured (e.g. inventory levels and the incidence of shortages).
- P17, 4th, Nowhere can indicators—and paired indicators—be of more help than in administrative work.
- P17, b, genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. It should be  should be a physical, countable thing.

  _By peering through the windows in the black box, we can get an idea of what the future output is likely to be._

- P20-22
  - _Leading indicators_: give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like. 
  - _Linear indicators_: A generally applicable example of a “window” cut into the black box; the linearity indicator flashes an early warning, allowing us time to take corrective action. Without it, we would discover that we had missed our target in June, when nothing can be done about it.
  - _Trend indicators_: These show output (breakfasts delivered, software modules completed, vouchers processed) measured against time (performance this month versus performance over a series of previous months), and also against some standard or expected level.

- P22, b, stagger chart: which forecasts an output over the next several months.
   - ![00009](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5671771/147892798-2013b075-6829-42b1-9498-02928ba89c6d.jpeg)

- P24, last, There are two ways to control the output of any factory. Some industries _build to order_; another is  _build to forecast,_ which is a contemplation of future orders

- P28, last, In the language of production, the lowest-value-point inspection where we inspect raw material is called _incoming material inspection_ or _receiving inspection_.
  - If we again use a black box to represent our production process, inspections that occur at intervening points within it are called, logically enough, _in-process inspections_.
  - Finally, the last possible point of inspection, when the product is ready to be shipped to the customer, is called _final inspection_ or _outgoing quality inspection_. 

- P30, 3rd, There is a _gate-like inspection_ and a _monitoring_ step.
  - In the former, all material is held at the “gate” until the inspection tests are completed.
  - In the latter, a sample of the material is taken, and if it fails, a notation is made from which a failure rate is calculated. The bulk of the material is not held as the sample is taken but continues to move through the manufacturing process.

- P31, 2nd, Another way to lower the cost of quality assurance is to use _variable inspections_. Because quality levels vary over time, it is only common sense to vary how often we inspect.

- P33, 3rd, The productivity of any function occurring within it is the output divided by the labor required to generate the output. 

- P35, 2nd, _leverage_, the output generated by a specific type of work activity.
  - An activity with high leverage will generate a high level of output; an activity with low leverage, a low level of output.
  - Automation is certainly one way to improve the leverage of all types of work. Having machines to help them, human beings can create more output. But in both widget manufacturing and administrative work, something else can also increase the productivity of the black box. This is called _work simplification_.

## 3 Managerial Leverage

- P40, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5671771/147893089-3c01e66d-ad10-4a74-82ec-0cc311d79cc0.png)

- P40, 2nd, If the manager is a knowledge specialist, a _know-how manager_, his potential for influencing “neighboring” organizations is enormous.
- P47, 1st, Like a housewife’s, a manager’s work is never done. There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done.
- P49, 2nd, To improve and maintain your capacity to get information, you have to understand the way it comes to you.
- P50, 2nd, transmitting objectives and preferred approaches constitutes a key to successful delegation.
- P51, 3rd, information-gathering is the basis of all other managerial work, which is why I choose to spend so much of my day doing it.
- P54, Managerial productivity—that is, the output of a manager per unit of time worked—can be increased in three ways:
  1.  Increasing the rate with which a manager performs his activities, speeding up his work.
  2.  Increasing the leverage associated with the various managerial activities.
  3.  Shifting the mix of a manager’s activities from those with lower to those with higher leverage.

- P54, high-leverage activities can be achieved in three basic ways:
  - When many people are affected by one manager.
  - When a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a manager’s brief, well-focused set of words or actions.
  - When a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge or information.

- P58, The art of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them. For me, paying close attention to customer complaints constitutes a high-leverage activity. 

- P60, 2nd, delegation without follow-through is _abdication_. 
- P61, 1st, A second principle applies to the frequency with which you check your subordinates’ work. 
  - How often you monitor should not be based on what you believe your subordinate can do in general, but on his experience with a specific task and his prior performance with it—his task-relevant maturity

- P62, 2nd, the most obvious way to increase managerial output is to increase the rate, or speed, of performing work.
- P64, 4th, It is important to say “no” earlier rather than later because we’ve learned that to wait until something reaches a higher value stage and then abort due to lack of capacity means losing more money and time. 

- P65, 2nd-4th,
  - The next production principle you can apply is to allow slack—a bit of looseness in your scheduling. 
  - Another production principle is very nearly the opposite. 
  - A final principle. Most production practices follow well-established procedures and, rather than reinventing the wheel repeatedly, use a specific method that has been shown to work before. 

- P66, 2nd, a manager should allocate about a half day per week to each of his subordinates. (Two days a week per subordinate would probably lead to meddling; an hour a week does not provide enough opportunity for monitoring.)
- P70, 2nd, channel the time needed to deal with them into organized, scheduled form by providing an alternative to interruption—a scheduled meeting or an office hour.
- P70, The point is to impose a pattern on the way a manager copes with problems. To make something regular that was once irregular is a fundamental production principle, and that’s how you should try to handle the interruptions that plague you.
