## How judgements happen

- System 1 can't deal with sum-like variables effectively; it works well with averages

## Answering an easier question

- P97, bottom, the concept of substitution
- P98, top, the definition of heuristic

### characteristics of system 1

- generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by System 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions
- operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort, and no sense of voluntary control
- can be programmed by System 2 to mobilize attention when a particular pattern is detected (search)
- executes skilled responses and generates skilled intuitions, after adequate training
- creates a coherent pattern of activated ideas in associative memory
- links a sense of cognitive ease to illusions of truth, pleasant feelings, and reduced vigilance
- distinguishes the surprising from the normal
- infers and invents causes and intentions
- neglects ambiguity and suppresses doubt
- is biased to believe and confirm
- exaggerates emotional consistency (halo effect)
- focuses on existing evidence and ignores absent evidence (WYSIATI)
- generates a limited set of basic assessments
- represents sets by norms and prototypes, does not integrate
- matches intensities across scales (e.g., size to loudness) computes more than intended (mental shotgun)
- sometimes substitutes an easier question for a difficult one (heuristics)
- is more sensitive to changes than to states (prospect theory)
- overweights low probabilities
- shows diminishing sensitivity to quantity (psychophysics)
- responds more strongly to losses than to gains (loss aversion)
- frames decision problems narrowly, in isolation from one another

## The law of small numbers

- P112, middle, for a research psychologist, sampling variation is not a curiosity; it is a nuisance and a costly obstacle, which turns the undertaking of every research project into a gamble.

- P115, top, Instead of focusing on how the event at hand came to be, the statistical view relates it to what could have happened instead. Nothing in particular caused it to be what it is - chance selected it from among its alternatives.

- P116, bottom, there is no such a thing as hot hand in professional basketball - research showed. It's related with the tendency to see patterns in randomness.

## Availability, emotion, and risk

- P139, top, people form opinions and make choices that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or avoid, often without knowing that they are doing so. 
- The emotional tail wags the rational dog. Jonathan Haidt
- P142, top, the availability cascade

## Tom W's specialty

- Base rate vs detailed description
- impact of Representativeness in decision making
- P154, bottom, the essential keys to disciplined Bayesian reasoning can be simply summarized:
  - Anchor your judgement of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate
  - Question the diagnosticity of your evidence

## Linda: less is more

- P158, bottom, conjunction fallacy: people commit when they judge a conjunction of two events to be more probable than one of the events in a direct comparison

## Causes trump statistics

- P174, top, subject's unwillingness to deduce particular to general was matched only by willingness to infer the general from the particular. 
- P174, bottom, surprising individual cases have a powerful impact and are more effective tool for teaching psychology because the incongruity must be resolved and embedded in causal story.

## Regression to the mean

- P177, top, 
  > success = talent + luck
  > great success = a little more talent + a lot of luck
- P181, bottom, regression and correlation are not two concepts; whenever the correlation between two scores is imperfect, there will be regression to the mean

## Taming intuitive predictions

- P192, top, intuitive predictions tend to be overconfident and overly extreme. 
- Extreme predictions and willingness to predict rare events from rare evidence are both manifestations of System 1.

## The illusion of understanding

- P199, top, narrative fallacy
- P202, middle, once you adopt a new view of the world (out of any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed. 
- P203, bottom, outcome bias

## The illusion of validity

-  P211, bottom, the illusion of validity
- P212, middle, Subjective confidence in a juagment is not a reasoned evaluation of the probability that this judgment is correct. Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and cognitive ease of processing it. It is wise to take admissions of uncertainty seriously, but declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true.

- P218, 2nd paragraph, march of history
- P220, top, hedgehog vs fox analogy

## Intuitions Vs formulas

- Paul Meehl, _clinical vs statistical prediction:a theoretical analysis and a review of the evidence_
- P225, top, inconsistency in personal evaluation is typical, which may be the main reason that leads to bad performance in human prediction
- P225, middle, inconsistency is destructive of any predictive ability

## Expert intuition: when to trust it?
- Malcolm Gladwell: _Blink_
- P236, bottom, recognition-primed decision 
- P237, top, Herbert Simon's definition of intuition: the situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition. 
- P240, top, confidence that people have in their intuition is not a reliable guide to their validity
- P240, 2nd paragraph, two basic conditions for acquiring a skill:
  - an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable
  - an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice
- P241, middle, intuition can't be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment. 
- P241, bottom, whether professionals have a chance to develop intuitive expertise depends essentially on the quality and speed of feedback,as well as on sufficient opportunity to practice.

## The outside view
- P249, 2nd paragraph, people who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the  class to which the case belongs.
- P250, top, _planning fallacy_, plans and forecasts that
  - are unrealistically close to best-case scenarios
  - could be improved by consulting the statistics of similar cases
- P251, bottom, _reference class forecasting_ (the treatment for the planning fallacy)
- P251, bottom, practices to overcome best-rate neglect:
  - Identify an appropriate reference class (kitchen renovations, large railway projects, etc.)
  - Obtain the statistics of the reference class (in terms of cost per mile of railway, or of the percentage by which expenditures exceeded budget), Use the statistics to generate a baseline prediction.
  - Use specific information about the case to adjust the baseline prediction, if there are particular reasons to expect the optimistic bias to be more or less pronounced in this project than in others of the same type.

## The engine of capitalism
- P259, bottom, cognitive biases play an important role, notably the System 1 feature WYSIATI.
  - We focus on our goal, anchor on our plan, and neglect relevant base rates, exposing ourselves to the planning fallacy
  - We focus on what we want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others
  - Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the. causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We are therefore prone to an _illusion of control_.
  - We focus on what we know and neglect what we don't know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs.
- P262, bottom, "one-arm economist" who will take a clear stand and won't keep saying "On the other hand..." in his/her reasoning
- P264, bottom, Gary Klein's proposal of _premortem_. When the organization has almost come to an important decision but has not formally committed itself, Klein proposes gathering for a brief session a group of individuals who are knowledgeable about the decision. The premise of the session is a short speech: "_Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster._"
