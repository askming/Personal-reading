## Introduction

- Financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and effort. That's true to some extent, and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I think more common), that financial success is not a hard science. It's a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.
- I love Voltaire's observation that "History never repeats itself; man always does."

## Chapter 1. No One's Crazy

- Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. So equally smart people can disagree about how and why recessions happen, how you should invest your money, what you should prioritize, how much risk you should take, and so on.
- As investor Michael Batnick says, "some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood." We are all victims, in different ways, to that truth.

## Chapter 2 Luck & Risk

- NYU professor Scott Galloway has a related idea that is so important to remember when judging success--both your own and others: "Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems."

- Two things can put you in a better direction
  - Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.
  - Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.

## Chapter 3 Never Enough

- The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving
- Social comparison is the problem here
- Enough is not too little
- There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain

- Happiness, as it's said, is just results minus expectations.

## Chapter 5 Getting Wealthy vs Staying Wealthy

- There are two reasons why a survival mentality is so key with
money.
  - One is the obvious: few gains are so great that they're worth
wiping yourself out over.
  - The other is the counterintuitive math of compounding

- Applying the survival mindset to the real world comes down to
appreciating three things.
  1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I'm unbreakable I actually think I'll get the biggest returns, because I'll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.
  2. Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.
  3. A barbelled personality--optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future-is vital.

- Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they
were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly
right.

## Chapter 6 Tails, You Win

- Anything that is huge, profitable, famous, or influential is the result of a tail event--an outlying one-in-thousands or millions event.

## Chapter 10 Save Money

- The first idea-simple, but easy to overlook--is that building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.

- More importantly, the value of wealth is relative to what you need.

- Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.

  - Everyone needs the basics. Once they're covered there's another
level of comfortable basics, and past that there's basics that are
both comfortable, entertaining, and enlightening.

- So people's ability to save is more in their control than they might think.

- And you don't need a specific reason to save.

- That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth.

- And that hidden return is becoming more important.

## Chapter 11 Reasonable > Rational

- With it comes something that often goes overlooked: Do not aim to be coldly rational when making financial decisions. Aim to just be pretty reasonable. Reasonable is more realistic and you have a better chance of sticking with it for the long run, which is what matters most when managing money.

## Chapter 12 Surprise!

- Two dangerous things happen when you rely too heavily on investment history as a guide to what's going to happen next.
  1. You'll likely miss the outlier events that move the needle the most.
  2. History can be a misleading guide to the future of the economy and stock market because it doesn't account for structural changes that are relevant to today's world.

- The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is
surprising.

- The average time between recessions has grown from about
two years in the late 180os to five years in the early 20th century to eight years over the last half-century.
