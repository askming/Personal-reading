## Introduction

### It's not a promotion, it's a career change
- once you've been doing it for a while, you'll realize that the best managers let their team make the decisions. Sure, they act as a tiebreaker every now and again, but their team should be driving things.
- Associating management with higher compensation is a classic trap companies fall into. It changes all the incentives for individual contributors (ICs) who want to further their careers.

- At its heart, management is an act of service. 
- So why become a manager?
  - Finding joy in the leverage of a high-performing team
  - Finding joy in your team's personal growth.

- The paradox of management is that the attitude that got you to that position isn‚Äôt the attitude that will make you successful at it.

- management is tactical and leadership is strategic.
  - Management requires dealing with the day-to-day realities of hiring and aligning people, such as one-on-ones, performance reviews, planning meetings, goal check-ins, etc. Leadership means looking forward, compounding value, connecting dots, taking cues from outside the organization, and talking to customers to come up with a vision that you can communicate to the rest of the company.

## 1 Managing yourself

### Managing your time and calendar

- The first rule in time management is to ruthlessly protect your time. 
  - Whenever someone asks for your time, instead of accepting a meeting, ask whether their issue could be resolved with a Slack message, Google Doc, or email instead.
  - If a meeting is inevitable, keep it as short as possible. Ensure that everyone is prepared for the meeting in order to make the most out of the time, and stack your meetings on specific days to ensure long periods of uninterrupted time outside those days where you can get focused work done.

```
- The second rule is to proactively design your calendar.

```{margin}
To learn how to identify your priorities and then categorize your recent activities accordingly, see [Getting things done](https://themanagershandbook.com/managing-yourself/getting-things-done).
```
- Each Sunday afternoon, write down your top 3 priorities for the week and design your calendar to spend 80%+ of your time on those priorities.

- In order to maximize your team‚Äôs output, you need to spend time on the activities that will influence that output the most.
- Use a color coding system when creating calendar events to group activities.
- An _energy audit_ is simply looking through your calendar and reflecting on which meetings give you energy, and which take energy from you. Then try to eliminate the latter category by hiring, delegating, and redistributing work.

### Getting things done
- All GTD systems all share two key insights.
  1. Your mind is made for having ideas, not for holding ideas.
  2. Creative work takes long periods of uninterrupted time. It is disrupted by context switching.

- How GTD works
  - Capture: capture 100% of everything that has your attention. Little, big, personal, and professional. 
  - Clarify: For everything you capture, decide if it is actionable.
  - Organize: Organize those actionable tasks by category and priority. 
  - Reflect: Look over your lists frequently to determine what to do next. Do a weekly review to bring yourself current, update your lists, and clear your mind.
  - Engage: Get to work. Choose your next action and get to it. 

- The good news is that you can apply GTD to email fairly simply. The key is to asynchronously batch process your email. Turn off all push notifications and only look at your email twice a day.

### Top goal
- Greg McKeown, who wrote a phenomenal book on productivity called Essentialism, boils this down to one key concept: Schedule an hour each day (that is, put an Event in your calendar) to work on your Top Goal only.

### Coaching
- Setting up your advisory board: Pick three to six people in your network who are either a few years ahead of you in their careers or are semi-retired.

### Physical health
- Developing good habits: It turns out that every habit starts with a psychological pattern called a "habit loop," which is a three-part process.
  - First, there's a cue, or trigger, that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and let a behavior unfold.
  - Then there's the routine, which is the behavior itself.
  - Lastly, there is the reward: something that your brain likes that helps it remember the "habit loop" in the future.
