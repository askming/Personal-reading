## Introduction

### It's not a promotion, it's a career change
- once you've been doing it for a while, you'll realize that the best managers let their team make the decisions. Sure, they act as a tiebreaker every now and again, but their team should be driving things.
- Associating management with higher compensation is a classic trap companies fall into. It changes all the incentives for individual contributors (ICs) who want to further their careers.

- At its heart, management is an act of service. 
- So why become a manager?
  - Finding joy in the leverage of a high-performing team
  - Finding joy in your team's personal growth.

- The paradox of management is that the attitude that got you to that position isn‚Äôt the attitude that will make you successful at it.

- management is tactical and leadership is strategic.
  - Management requires dealing with the day-to-day realities of hiring and aligning people, such as one-on-ones, performance reviews, planning meetings, goal check-ins, etc. Leadership means looking forward, compounding value, connecting dots, taking cues from outside the organization, and talking to customers to come up with a vision that you can communicate to the rest of the company.

## 1 Managing yourself

### Managing your time and calendar

- The first rule in time management is to ruthlessly protect your time. 
  - Whenever someone asks for your time, instead of accepting a meeting, ask whether their issue could be resolved with a Slack message, Google Doc, or email instead.
  - If a meeting is inevitable, keep it as short as possible. Ensure that everyone is prepared for the meeting in order to make the most out of the time, and stack your meetings on specific days to ensure long periods of uninterrupted time outside those days where you can get focused work done.

- The second rule is to proactively design your calendar.
