Personal review: ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ; personal recommendation: neutral.

This book provides good insights on how one can influence people around us by explaining/summarizing some core psychological and sociological concepts in human interactions with abundant examples. Understanding and implementing these tactics in daily interactions is the key to influence others and achieve our goals.

Although the core ideas of the this books is valuable and much appreciated. The way how the books is written, with lengthy and academic style language and examples, is a bit too heavy for a daily read. Thus, I skip most of the main content and just read the summaries from each chapter.

## Chapter 1 Weapons of influence

- Fixed-action pattens: regular, blindly mechanical patterns of action in a wide variety of species.
  - trigger feature, e.g. the cheep-cheep sound of young turkey

- rather than thinking about an expert's arguments and being convinced (or not), we frequently ignore the arguments and allow ourselves to be convinced just by the expert's status as "expert."
  - This tendency to respond mechanically to one piece of information in a situation is what we have been calling automatic or _click, whir_ responding; the tendency to react on the basis of a thorough analysis of all of the information can be referred to as _controlled responding_. 

- The contrast principle in human perception 

- Summary
  - Ethologists, researchers who study animal behavior in the natural environment, have noticed that among many animal species behavior often occurs in rigid and mechanical patterns. Called fixed-action patterns, these mechanical behavior sequences are noteworthy in their similarity to certain automatic (click, whirr) responding by humans. For both humans and subhumans, the automatic behavior patterns tend to be triggered by a single feature of the relevant information in the situation. This single feature, or trigger feature, can often prove very valuable by allowing an individual to decide on a correct course of action without having to analyze carefully and completely each of the other pieces of information in the situation.
  - The advantage of such shortcut responding lies in its efficiency and economy; by reacting automatically to a usually informative trigger feature, an individual preserves crucial time, energy, and mental capacity. The disadvantage of such responding lies in its vulnerability to silly and costly mistakes; by reacting to only a piece of the available information (even a normally predictive piece), an individual increases the chances of error, especially when responding in an automatic, mindless fashion. The chances of error increase even further when other individuals seek to profit by arranging (through manipulation of trigger features) to stimulate a desired behavior at inappropriate times.
  - Much of the compliance process (wherein one person is spurred to comply with another person's request) can be understood in terms of a human tendency for automatic, shortcut responding. Most individuals in our culture have developed a set of trigger features for compliance, that is, a set of specific pieces of information that normally tell us when compliance with a request is likely to be correct and beneficial. Each of these trigger features for compliance can be used like a weapon (of influence) to stimulate people to agree to requests.
